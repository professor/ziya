== DESCRIPTION:

ZiYa allows you to easily display graphs in your ruby based applications by leveraging
SWF Charts (http://www.maani.us/xml_charts/index.php) and SWF gauges (http://www.maani.us/gauge/index.php). 
This gem bundles version 5.03 and 1.6 of these flash libraries. Incorporating flash graphs or gauge in your app 
relieves the server by allowing for delegating graph rendering to the client side. Using this gem, you will
be able to easily create great looking charts for your application. You will also be able
to use the charts or gauges has a navigation scheme by embedding various link in the graphical components
thus bring to the table an ideal scheme for reporting and dashboard like applications. Your
managers will love you for it !!

== FEATURES:

*  Allows you to style your charts just like you would an html page using css styles
   philosophy. Each chart can be associated with a YAML file that allows you to specify
   preferences based on SWF Charts properties. Chart style sheet reside under 
   public/charts/themes. By default all styling resides under the 'default' directory.
   Each chart type may have an associated YAML file. You can either inherit the default
   styles or define your own by specifying an id when you create your graph. The styles 
   will cascade thru your graph class hierarchy and override default preferences as you
   would in a style sheet.

   NOTE: XML/SWF charts are free of charge unless you need to use special features such
   as embedded links and printing. 
   The package cost $45 per domain and is well worth the investment. A similar fee applies
   to the gauge framework.

*  We are leveraging ERB within the YAML file to provide access to the chart/gauge state. State
   can be passed in via the options hash when the graph/gauge is generated.
   You can also define your own methods in helpers/ziya/xxx_helper. Where xxYou can access these
   helper methods in your style file just like you would in a rails template.

*  Theme support. You can change the appearance and behavior of any charts by introducing
   new themes under the public/charts/themes directory.

== REQUIREMENTS:

  ZiYa depends on the logging gem version > 0.9.0  

== INSTALL:
  
  On rubyforge
  
  sudo gem install ziya
  
  or github
  
  sudo gem install derailed-ziya
  
  cd to your application directory and issue the following command
  
  > ziyafy
  
  This will copy the necessary themes and flash files to run ziya in your application 
  public/charts directory.
      
== SYNOPSIS:
  
  IMPORTANT: This new gem version requires a client update to flash 9.0 and possibly you will
  need to get a new license from XML/SWF ( $45.0 for your domain ), if you want to use
  advanced features like links and live updates.
  Also some api's have changed. I will try to push a new sample application and more docs in the
  next few weeks. So make sure you try this out first in a non production environment and report
  bugs or side effects. I'll do my best to keep up with the demand. If anyone would like to give
  me a hand with a tutorial app or improving the docs, I am all hears...
  
  

  When using within a rails application you will need to create a ziya.rb file in your
  config/initializers directory ( Rails 2.0 )
  
  ziya.rb:
  
    # Pull in the ZiYa gem framework
    gem "ziya", "~> 2.0.0"
    require 'ziya'

    # Initializes the ZiYa Framework
    Ziya.initialize( :logger      => RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER,
                     :helpers_dir => File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__), %w[.. .. app helpers ziya] ),
                     :themes_dir  => File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__), %w[.. .. public charts themes]) )  
  
   This will initialize the gem. You can log the output to stdout as well using the ZiYa bundled logger
   or specify a file ie File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__), %w[.. log ziya.log]. If you choose to use the 
   ZiYa logger, you can specify the :log_level option to either :warn :info :debug or :error.
   You will need to indicate your themes directory typically located under public/charts/themes or any location
   you'll choose. Otherwise ZiYa will used the default themes from <<the gem ie default or commando.
   Lastly you can specify a custom helper directory :helpers_dir, so you can use helper methods within your 
   ZiYa stylesheets.
   
   NOTE: You must create the app/helpers/ziya and public/chart/themes directory in your application
   
*  Creating a chart
   
   blee_controller.rb
   
     class BleeController < ApplicationController
       helper Ziya::Helper
       
       # Callback from the flash movie to get the chart's data
       def load_chart
         chart = Ziya::Charts::Bar.new
         chart.add( :axis_category_text, %w[2006 2007 2008] )
         chart.add( :series, "Dogs", [10,20,30] )
         chart.add( :series, "Cats", [5,15,25] )
         respond_to do |fmt|
          fmt.xml { render :xml => chart.to_xml }
       end
     end
     
   blee/index.html.erb
   
   <%= ziya_chart load_chart_url, :size => "300x200" -%>
      
   # Create a named route for the chart. In the previous line, ziya_chart is a helper function that lays down the
necessary html to embed the flash movie in your page. The call ziya_chart takes a url which will be a callback to your
webserver to fetch the xml necessary to hydrate the chart. In this case load_chart_path is a
named route that calls the load_path action on the controller.  

   config/routes.rb

   map.load_chart '/blee/load_chart', :controller => 'blee', :action => 'load_chart'
   
* Creating a gauge

  You will need to modify the ziya initializer and add the following directive
  
    Ziya.initialize( :logger      => RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER,
                   :helpers_dir => File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__), %w[.. .. app helpers ziya] ),
                   :designs_dir => File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__), %w[.. .. public gauges designs] ), # => Add this !!
                   :themes_dir  => File.join( File.dirname(__FILE__), %w[.. .. public charts themes]) )  
                 
  fred_controller.rb
  
    class FredController < ApplicationController
      def load_gauge
        gauge = Ziya::Gauges::Base.new( @license_key, 'my_gauge' )
         respond_to do |fmt|
          fmt.xml => { render :xml => gauge.to_xml }
         end
      end        
    end
    
   fred/index.html.erb
   
   <%= ziya_gauge load_gauge_url, :size => "300x200" -%>

   config/routes.rb
   
   # Creates a named route for the chart.
   map.load_gauge '/fred/load_gauge', :controller => 'fred', :action => 'load_gauge'
  
  public/gauges/designs/my_gauge.yml

  In the design file you will leverage the components defined in the Ziya::Gauges::Support
  package to create your gauge desgins. You gauges can be animated using rotate, scale and 
  move operations. In this example we will create a volume control that will rotate to the
  desired position. In real life you will fetch the volume level from your models to
  set the desired position. Take a look at the ZiYa sample application for the various 
  possibilities. You can think of a gauge as a portable canvas element where you can draw
  you own designs using the various components provided ZiYa components ( No need to worry about
  various browsers' canvas support )

      # specifies the number of ticks to draw in a circular fashion
